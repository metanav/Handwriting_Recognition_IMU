# Handwriting Recognition
In this project, I build a pen device which can be used to recognize handwritten numerals. As its input, it takes multidimensional accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data. Its output will be a simple classification that notifies us if one of several classes of movements, in this case 0 to 9 digit, has recently occurred.

## Required Hardware Components
1. [Sparkfun Artemis ATP](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15442)
2. [SparkFun 9DoF IMU Breakout - ICM-20948 (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335)
3. [SparkFun Qwiic Cable - 500mm](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14429)
4. [Seeed Grove - Mech Keycap](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Mech-Keycap.html)
5. [Gameduino 3](https://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino3/index.html)
6. Micro SD card

## Required Softwares and Libraries
1. [Arduino IDE 1.8.12](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. [TensorFlow 2.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
3. [SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary](https://github.com/metanav/SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary)

Please see the instructions [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-arduino) to setup Artemis ATP board with Arduino IDE.


## Data Collection
Use [data_collection.ino](https://github.com/metanav/Handwriting_Recognition_IMU/tree/master/sketches/data_collection) in the sketches directory to collect data from the IMU sensor.

## Training
Use [train.ipynb](https://github.com/metanav/Handwriting_Recognition_IMU/blob/master/train.ipynb) to train the model.
You can use a GPU or CPU to train.

## Inferencing
Use [handwriting_recognizer.ino](https://github.com/metanav/Handwriting_Recognition_IMU/tree/master/sketches/handwriting_recognizer) to recognize handwritten numerals from the data coming from IMU sensor motion.
